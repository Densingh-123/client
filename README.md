## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd library-book-management
```

### Backend Setup

1. **Create MySQL Database**:
   - Database Name: `test`
   - Table Name: `books`
   - Table Schema:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE books (
         id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
         title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
         `desc` TEXT,
         price DECIMAL(10, 2),
         cover VARCHAR(255)
     );
     ```

2. **Install Backend Dependencies**:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

3. **Run the Backend**:
```bash
node index.js
```
Your backend server will start on [http://localhost:8800](http://localhost:8800).

### Frontend Setup

1. **Install Frontend Dependencies**:
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

2. **Run the Frontend**:
```bash
npm start
```
Your frontend app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Update a Book
Click the "Edit" button next to a book to update its details.

### Delete a Book
Click the "Delete" button to remove a book from the database.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view in the browser. The page reloads if you make edits.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. React is optimized for the best performance.

## Deployment

To deploy the application, follow these steps:

1. Build the frontend:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. Host the `build` folder on a web server or a cloud service like Netlify.

3. Deploy the backend to a hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS).
