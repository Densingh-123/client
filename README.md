     ```

2. **Install Backend Dependencies**:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

3. **Run the Backend**:

### Update a Book
Click the "Edit" button next to a book to update its details.

### Delete a Book
Click the "Delete" button to remove a book from the database.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view in the browser. The page reloads if you make edits.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. React is optimized for the best performance.

## Deployment

To deploy the application, follow these steps:

1. Build the frontend:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. Host the `build` folder on a web server or a cloud service like Netlify.

3. Deploy the backend to a hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS).
